# User-Engagement-Project
 This is project in which i have analysed and A/B testing dataset

# A/B Testing
It is a hypothesis testing for a randomized experiment with two variables A and B. 
The goal of A/B Testing is to identify any changes to the web page to maximize or increase the outcome 
of interest. A/B testing is a fantastic method for figuring out the best online promotional and marketing 
strategies for your business. It can be used to test everything from website copy to sales emails to search 
ads. An example of this could be identifying the click-through rate for a banner ad.
## Analysis Results  
A/B Testing Analysis
The analysis shows that overall effect of UI change is good as we can see from the bar plot. The daily 
average time is average time spent on the website by a user. The plot below show’s male users and 
unknown’s users are loving the Quora already (as compared to females) and this new UI acted as 
catalyst for their time spent on Quora.

Suggestion: From the plot I can say that we have to do research that why female users are less enagaged
This is a plot of control group and we can see that female and unknown contributors are not loving the 
old UI.

The plot below is of treatment group and here we can see that every type of user is loving the new UI. 
Most of users are spending more time on website.
In this case I have suggestion that we should push this to production as it is not having any bad effect on 
any type of users.
