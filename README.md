# A/B Testing
It is a hypothesis testing for a randomized experiment with two variables A and B. 
The goal of A/B Testing is to identify any changes to the web page to maximize or increase the outcome 
of interest. A/B testing is a fantastic method for figuring out the best online promotional and marketing 
strategies for your business. It can be used to test everything from website copy to sales emails to search
